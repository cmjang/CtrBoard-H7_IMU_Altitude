This program is a BSD_Client example running on Network Dual Stack.
It is used to send commands to a BSD_Server or LEDSwitch server
connected on the same LAN.

In order to run this example, you need to use auto-assigned IPv6 address
or set IPv4 address to match your local area network.

To test this example, you need also a server application to connect to.
Download and run a BSD_Server or LEDSwitch server on a different evaluation
board connected to the same LAN. When BSD_Client is running, LED diodes on
both evaluation boards should light in sync.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addresses on BSD_Server.

The BSD_Client program is a standalone application preconfigured for
STM32H743I-EVAL Evaluation Board.

The BSD_Client example is available in different targets:
