This is a simple example which shows how to setup emWin Graphic Library
for the ST 'STM32H743IG-EVAL' Kit.

The emWin Example is available in different targets:

 - Debug:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Source

 - Release:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 3
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Library
