This is a File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy and delete files on any enabled
drive (SD/MMC Card, NOR/NAND Flash) and format each drive.

Detailed description is available on:

The File_Demo program is a standalone application preconfigured for
STM32H743I-EVAL Evaluation Board using ST-Link Debugger and ITM debug
port as a communication interface.

You can test it from uVision Debug Session:
  Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
  Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).

The File_Demo program is available in different targets:

 - Debug:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Enabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Source
   - File System:CORE:          Debug

 - Release:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Disabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Library
   - File System:CORE           Release

Note:
  - Card Detect pin handling is done in MCI_ReadCD function. Define
    MemoryCard_CD0_Pin_Extern is required to enable Card Detect bit
    in MCI driver capabilities.
