LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs,
please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

protective of the Licensed Software and ST’s rights in the Licensed Software as
this Agreement (including without limitation a warranty disclaimer and a
limitation of liability as protective of ST as those contained in this
Agreement).

OWNERSHIP AND COPYRIGHT

Title to the Licensed Software, related documentation and all copies thereof
remain with ST and/or its licensors. You may not remove any copyright notice,
warranty disclaimer, or other proprietary notice from the Licensed Software or
from any permitted copies of the Licensed Software. You shall prevent any

defined below) applicable for each such portion (Open Source Software), as
further specified in the Licensed Software. Such Open Source Software is
supplied under the applicable Open Source Terms and is not subject to the terms
and conditions of license hereunder. By installing copying, downloading,
accessing or otherwise using the Licensed Software, You agree to be bound by
such Open Source Terms with regard to such Open Source Software. Open Source
Terms: mean any open source license which requires as part of distribution of
software that the source code of such software is distributed therewith or
otherwise made available, or open source license that substantially complies
with the Open Source definition specified at www.opensource.org and any other
comparable open source license such as for example GNU General Public License
(GPL), Eclipse Public License (EPL), Apache Software License, BSD license and
MIT license.

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

Certain portions of the Licensed Software may be subject to third party license
terms as expressly specified in the Licensed Software. In such event, those
portions are supplied under the specified third party license terms and are not
subject to the license terms of this Agreement. By installing copying,
downloading, accessing or otherwise using the Licensed Software, You agree to be
bound by such third party license terms with regard to those portions.

NO OTHER RIGHTS OR LICENSES

No rights or licenses are granted to You, except as expressly stated in this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no rights or
licenses are granted in any products, technology or intellectual property rights
of ST except those embodied in the Licensed Software.

NO WARRANTY

The Licensed Software is provided “as is” and “with all faults” without warranty
of any kind expressed or implied. ST and its licensors expressly disclaim all
warranties, expressed, implied or otherwise, including without limitation,
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement of intellectual property rights. ST does not warrant that the
use in whole or in part of the Licensed Software will be interrupted or error
free, will meet Your requirements, or will operate with the combination of
hardware and software selected by You.

You are responsible for determining whether the Licensed Software will be
suitable for your intended use or application or will achieve your intended
results. ST will not be liable to You and/or to any third party for the
derivative works of the Licensed Software developed by You.

ST has not authorised anyone to make any representation or warranty for the
Licensed Software, and any technical, applications or design information or
advice, quality characterization, reliability data or other services provided by
ST shall not constitute any representation or warranty by ST or alter this
disclaimer or warranty, and no additional obligations or liabilities beyond
those explicitly stated in this Agreement shall arise from ST’s providing such
information or services. ST does not assume or authorize any other person to
assume for it any other liability in connection with the Licensed Software.

Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as:

(i) a warranty or representation by ST to maintain production of any ST device
or other hardware or software with which the Licensed Software may be used or to
otherwise maintain or support the Licensed Software in any manner; or

(ii) a commitment from ST and/or its licensors to bring or prosecute actions or
suits against third parties for infringement of any of the rights licensed
hereby, or conferring any rights to bring or prosecute actions or suits against
third parties for infringement. However, ST has the right to terminate this
Agreement immediately upon receiving notice of any claim, suit or proceeding
that alleges that the Licensed Software or Your use or distribution of the
Licensed Software infringes any third party intellectual property rights.

All other warranties, conditions or other terms implied by law are excluded to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES

In no event shall ST or its licensors be liable to You or any third party for
any indirect, special, consequential, incidental, punitive damages or other
damages (including but not limited to, the cost of labor, re-qualification,
delay, loss of profits, loss of revenues, loss of data, costs of procurement of
substitute goods or services or the like) whether based on contract, tort, or
any other legal theory, relating to or in connection with the Licensed Software,
the documentation or this Agreement, even if ST has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

In no event shall ST’s liability to You or any third party under this Agreement,
including any claim with respect of any third party intellectual property
rights, for any cause of action exceed 100 US$. This section does not apply to
the extent prohibited by law. For the purposes of this section, any liability of
ST shall be treated in the aggregate.

TERMINATION

ST may terminate this Agreement, including its licenses, at any time if You are
in material breach of any of its terms and conditions and You have failed to
cure such breach within 30 (thirty) days after receiving notification from ST of
such breach. Upon termination, You will immediately destroy or return all copies
of the Licensed Software (including without limitation any documentation) to ST.
After termination, Your sole surviving right will be to continue to use the
Licensed Software solely to the extent that it was already incorporated before
Your material breach of this Agreement into Your Products, which were sold by
You before the date of Your material breach.

APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Agreement and matters connected with the validity, interpretation or
performance thereof shall be governed, construed, interpreted, and applied in
all respects by the law in place in Switzerland, without resort to conflict of
laws principles. The Parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this
Agreement or to their relationship.

Dispute Resolution. The Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction in the court
of Canton of Geneva, Switzerland for purposes of any litigation arising from
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section shall
prevent either Party seeking interim injunctive relief from a court or tribunal
of appropriate jurisdiction.

SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this agreement is or becomes, at any time or for any reason,
unenforceable or invalid, no other provision of this agreement shall be affected
thereby, and the remaining provisions of this agreement shall continue with the
same force and effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions had not
been inserted in this Agreement.

WAIVER

The failure or delay of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent
breach of the same or a different provision.

ASSIGNMENT

This Agreement may not be assigned by You, nor any of Your rights or obligations
hereunder, to any third party without prior written consent of ST. In the event
that this Agreement is assigned effectively to a third party, this Agreement
shall bind upon successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

Nothing in this Agreement shall create, or be deemed to create, a partnership or
the relationship of principal and agent or employer and employee between the
Parties. Neither Party has the authority or power to bind, to contract in the
name of or to create a liability for the other in any way or for any purpose.
