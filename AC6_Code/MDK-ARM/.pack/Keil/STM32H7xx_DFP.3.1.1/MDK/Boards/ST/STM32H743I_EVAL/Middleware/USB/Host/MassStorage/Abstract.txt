This is an USB Host Mass Storage and File System example.

After the USB Flash memory stick is connected it creates/overwrites 
a file with name "Test.txt" and content "USB Host Mass Storage!".

Board:                  ST 'STM32H743I-EVAL'
Microcontroller:        ST 'STM32H743XIH6'
Clock Settings:         XTAL        =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK      = 400 MHz
                        USB HS1 CLK =  60 MHz (from external ULPI PHY)
                        USB HS2 CLK =  48 MHz
USB:                    OTG_HS1 high-speed (connector CN14)
                        OTG_HS2 full-speed (connector CN18)
User Interface:         none
