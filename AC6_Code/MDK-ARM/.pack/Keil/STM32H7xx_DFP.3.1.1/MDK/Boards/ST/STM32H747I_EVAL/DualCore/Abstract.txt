The 'DualCore' multi project demonstrates how to configure dual core application projects
in order to use STM32H7 CM7 core together with STM32H7 M4 core.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - HSE     =  25 MHz
   - CM7     = 400 MHz  (SYSCLK)
   - CM4     = 200 MHz  (HCLK)

 - CM7 blinks LED1
 - CM7 synchronizes CM4 start using  HW semaphore
 - CM4 toggles LED2 .. LED4 upon request from CM7 (pushing Tamper button)

Note:
 - CM4 application is flashed together with CM7 application from CM7 project.
 - used STM32H7 Option Bytes configuration:
  - CM4 boot enabled
  - CM7 boot enabled
